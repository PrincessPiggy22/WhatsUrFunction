### Review Questions:
#### Why doesn't the integer change after the method call?
Because it's only being Modfied w/ in the scope of the Method
#### Why does the array change after the method call?
Because when your editing an array, you are changing the values in the memory
#### What happens when you try to access y outside the loop?
It will not work because Y was defined in the scope of the for loop, not in the scope of the Method
